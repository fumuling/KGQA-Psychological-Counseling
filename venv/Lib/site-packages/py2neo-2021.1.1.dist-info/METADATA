**Py2neo** is a client library and toolkit for working with `Neo4j <https://neo4j.com/>`_ from within `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ applications and from the command line.
The library supports both Bolt and HTTP and provides a high level API, an OGM, admin tools, an interactive console, a Cypher lexer for Pygments, and many other bells and whistles.

As of version 2021.1, Py2neo contains full support for routing, as exposed by a Neo4j cluster.
This can be enabled using a ``neo4j://...`` URI or by passing ``routing=True`` to a ``Graph`` constructor.


Quick Example
-------------

To run a query against a local database is straightforward::

    >>> from py2neo import Graph
    >>> graph = Graph("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))
    >>> graph.run("UNWIND range(1, 3) AS n RETURN n, n * n as n_sq")
       n | n_sq

Releases & Versioning
---------------------

As of 2020, py2neo has switched to `Calendar Versioning <https://calver.org/>`_, using a scheme of ``YYYY.N.M``.
Here, ``N`` is an incrementing zero-based number for each year, and ``M`` is a revision within that version (also zero-based).

No compatibility guarantees are given between versions, but as a general rule, a change in ``M`` should require little-to-no work within client applications,
whereas a change in ``N`` may require some work. A change to the year is likely to require a more significant amount of work to upgrade.

Note that py2neo is developed on a rolling basis, so patches are not made to old versions.
Users will instead need to install the latest release to adopt bug fixes.

The following versions of Python and Neo4j (all editions) are supported:

- Python 2.7 / 3.4 / 3.5 / 3.6 / 3.7 / 3.8 / 3.9
- Neo4j 3.4 / 3.5 / 4.0 / 4.1 / 4.2 / 4.3 (the latest point release of each version is recommended)

Py2neo provides support for the multi-database functionality added in Neo4j 4.0.
More about this can be found in the documentation for the ``Graph`` class.

Note also that Py2neo is developed and tested under **Linux** using standard CPython distributions.
While other operating systems and Python distributions may work, support for these is not available.
